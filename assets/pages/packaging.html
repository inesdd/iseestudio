                  <hr class="project-line">
                  <p>This packaging project arises from the market study in the alcoholic beverage sector, more specifically, in the Tequila sector, and after analyzing the sector and finding its weakest points, the following questions arose: what to do with the container of an alcoholic beverage? how to get the consumer to look at it and not discard it? 
                    <br><br>
                    Raíz brand and its subsequent strategy and design arose from these questions. The objective of this project is to create a different, practical and functional packaging. Something that is more than just a pretty bottle and that the customer can reuse if he wants to, thus supporting sustainability and reuse of packaging and products.

            For this, the main idea consisted of a square bottle, which would be similar to a cologne bottle and at the same time to a flask. So, this would serve as a flask or as a bottle to carry your own alcohol (there are times when the customer knows in advance that he is not going to drink the whole bottle and only needs a small amount, this bottle is perfect to reuse on those occasions). 
            Finally, when designing the bottle, it was decided to create two different formats, one that could be used in bars, for example, of 75 cl., since there is a bigger consumption, and the "flask" format, of 35 cl., smaller and more manageable, with a leather case.

              <p>THE LAST, is a prototype of a beer brand, which refers to the Spanish slang, especially to that moment of happiness, when you are enjoying the company at the bar and ask for "the last", how many times have we heard that word, with the intention of not going home. 
                <br><br>
                The concept that has been developed throughout the design for the packaging of the brand "The last", has been to connect with a young audience from a design and messages according to the type of information they are accustomed to consume, whether music, images on social networks, texts, etc.. That translates into the design of the subsequent labeling of the glass bottles.

                "The last" could be placed within the Millennial Culture trend, since it is committed to an innovative and more youthful design, and aims to approach the most urban trends. 
                The labels allow us to differentiate the three types of beers offered by the brand as follows: PORTER (Psychedelic Rock), IPA (Psychedelic PoP) and AAA (Psychedelic Cumbia).
